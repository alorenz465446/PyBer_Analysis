# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview

Analyzing rideshare data with Python, PANDAS, and Matplotlib.

## Background 
Customer's guidance:

* Using Python skills and knowledge of Pandas, create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type was created. 
* Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, create a multiple-line graph shows the total weekly fares for each city type. 
* Create a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.


## Results

## Summary

Urban areas have more riders and drivers. Which is also producing higher fares than other city types like rural and suburban. The fares on average cost more in rural and suburban areas since there are fewer drivers in these areas. Fares for each type of city all seem to spike at the end of February.


### Software
* Matplotlib version 3.5.1
* Jupyter Notebook 6.4.8
* Python 3.7.2
